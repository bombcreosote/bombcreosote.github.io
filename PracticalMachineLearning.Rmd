This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## Script for predicting the manner in which some people did the exercise, using the given data.
## The prediction variable is "classe".

## Reading the data sets.
setwd("G:/uni/master/anul 2/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Model")

## Loading packages
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)

## Creating the training and testing sets based on available data
data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=data$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- data[inTrain,]
testing <- data[-inTrain,]


## Some variables have only NA values, we don't want them as preditictors for the model
count <- vector(mode="numeric",length=0)
for (i in 1:160) {
  if (!is.na(training[1,i])) {
    count <- c(count,i)
  }
}
## count is a vector containing the index for each variable that doesn't have a NA on the first ## row, as 90% of their values are missing, we need to remove these variables from our training ## and testing sets
training<- training[count]
testing <- testing[count]

## We also don't need the first 5 variables

training <- training[c(-1, -2, -3, -4, -5)]
testing <- testing[c(-1, -2, -3, -4, -5)]
## Only variables without missing values and those that are not representing stats on other variables
## will be filtered out. In total 53 predictors will be used to predict the classe variable

training <- training[,order(names(training))]
testing <- testing[,order(names(testing))]
names(training)
count2<- c(1:12, 16:28, 41:52, 61:68, 81:88)
training <- training[count2]
testing <- testing[count2]

## Build predictions with random forests

library(randomForest)

set.seed(647)

fit <- randomForest(classe ~., data=training, importance=TRUE)
pred <- predict(fit, testing)

## In random forests, there is no need for cross-validation or a separate test set to get an 
## unbiased estimate of the test set error.
fit
table(pred, testing$classe)

## Predicting the 20 values for "classe"
testing2 <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
pred2 <- predict(fit, testing2)
pred2


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
varImpPlot(fit)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
